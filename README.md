uShowcase
=========

**uShowcase is a photo gallery for Umbraco.**

It comes with a very simple template which is easily modifiable but also usable right away.

Features:

* Multiple galleries  
* Rich text page documents  
* Super easy to modify template  

Under home, there is a Galleries page. This will not show up in the navigation. Create `Gallery` pages inside Galleries, and inside the `Gallery` pages, create `Photo` pages.

The template uses bootstrap but the uShowcase photo grid system doesn't, so you don't *have* to have Bootstrap.

Requires ImageGen version 2.5.7 to run:

*Version 1.0.1 has only been tested with Umbraco v6.0.3 - so bear that in mind.*
